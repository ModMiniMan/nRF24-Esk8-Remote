# nRF24-Esk8-Remote

After building and hacking several together, I ended up with this design of my own based on electronics and software from SolidGeek (available at https://github.com/SolidGeek/nRF24-Esk8-Remote).
 
The remote I designed has the following features:

- A dead man's switch which deactivates the throttle when the remote is not held (safety feature because the trigger can accidentally go off otherwise, ask me how I know)
- A mode switch which swaps between displayed data (Speed, distance, battery voltage, Ah drawn, current draw)
- Ergonomic OLED display position so you don't need to twist your wrist to read it.
- Menu to adjust settings
- Programmable deck selection via menu
- Calibration of throttle via menu
- Ambidextrous design, swap to left hand use by adjusting the script-
- Skate bearing used in trigger mechanism for smoother operation as well just a fun detail considering it's meant for an esk8
- Hall sensor instead of potentiometer to prevent potential wear of a pot
